# RAMP starting kit on salary prediction

Predict the salary of any worker in the world based on many features (Education, years of experience, ...) with a training dataset on which to build a model which eventually includes the salary.
The challenge in this RAMP is to design an algorithm to automatically predict the salary using regression

```

If you are using `conda`, we provide an `environment.yml` file for similar
usage.

### Challenge description

Get started on this RAMP with the
[dedicated notebook](salary_prediction.ipynb).

### Test a submission

The submissions need to be located in the `submissions` folder. For instance
for `my_submission`, it should be located in `submissions/my_submission`.

To run a specific submission, you can use the `ramp-test` command line:
